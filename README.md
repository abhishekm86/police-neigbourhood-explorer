#  Police Neighbourhood Explorer

Police Neighbourhood Explorer is a demo application(based on UK Police Data API) that allows users to explore events for an individual neighbourhood. 

A user is able to navigate a list of police forces and neighbourhoods to identify a particular neighbourhood to view details of upcoming events in that neighbourhood.

## Features

## Prerequisites
The application uses [Node Package Manager(NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install multiples packages.

Make sure you have the latest version ( > 6.10 ) of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed before starting the installation process.

## Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Use the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to start the installation of all the dependancies by using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
Once the dependancies finish installing you can start the application by running
```bash
npm start
```
This runs the application in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
